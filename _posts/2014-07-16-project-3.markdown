description: The primary objective of this project is to use facial and hand gesture recognition to translate real-time movements into in-game controls. This technology has the potential to make Minecraft accessible to differently-abled individuals who may struggle with conventional control mechanisms such as keyboards and mice. By doing so, our project not only aims to enhance the gaming experience but also make an iconic game like Minecraft accessible to a broader audience.
