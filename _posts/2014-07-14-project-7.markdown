description: This project focuses on the use of AI and robotics in darts and aims to enable a humanoid AI robot, Gretchen, to precisely detect scores on a dartboard. Using computer vision and polar coordinate analysis, we modified Gretchen to interact with the physical game environment, overcoming the challenges of object recognition and robotic precision. As a result Gretchen was able to successfully calculate the scores during darts. This work not only demonstrates the possibilities of AI and robotics in precision sports, but also creates a baseline for future work on human-robot interaction in traditional games.
